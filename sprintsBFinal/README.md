# monster-ranking
This project is an attempt to catalogue and rank all the mosters across America. It is not finished yet, clearly, but it was a way to test how the formatting for such a project would run. It is a react project that pulls from google's firestore for data storage. Moving forward this project could become an interactive platform where others can see which monster have been ranked what by their friends. Eventually this system would lead us to find the statistically most terrifying monster in America.
